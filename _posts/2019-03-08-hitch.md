I was studying in Edinburgh. I don't remember exactly how I got into hitchhiking. Sometime in early March, my friend Reigh and I were sharing our experience of studying abroad. She told me that she had recently hitched from coast to coast in Ireland along with a female friend of hers. Incidentally, I had spent the night prior to our conversation watching random videos related to hitchhiking. To say the least, I was amazed by her story and she encouraged me to give hitchhiking a try.

This is my story of solo hitchhiking over a thousand miles in Europe as a brown male. It is an attempt to document an experience I truly cherish. I have used [Google Maps Timeline](https://www.google.com/maps/timeline) extensively to try to recall the foggy memories.

### The Fails: The Netherlands üá≥üá±

Once I got my Schengen visa, I was all set to visit my friend Aman in Eindhoven. I was pumped and asked him if he wanted to try hitching in the Netherlands. He agreed, no questions asked. We began scouring loads of pages on [hitchwiki.org](http://hitchwiki.org), an encyclopedia for hitchhikers. We both had our doubts and I would be lying if I tell you that I wasn't nervous. The good thing was that Aman was familiar with public transportation there, so we knew we had a fallback option if we were to get no rides whatsoever.

Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened. We tried thrice in three different locations, waiting for around two hours each, but didn't manage to get a single ride. Funnily enough, the only car that stopped for us was police asking us to move to a different, safer place. Although we were standing in a legal spot, we didn't want to take a chance so we moved to another spot.

The next day, we stuck our thumbs out in front of a traffic signal. It was uncomfortable whenever we'd make eye contact with any passengers. **We still followed all the basics: shave before going out, smile generously, look them in the eyes, and show both hands.** Some of them did smile back but none of the cars stopped. I think the reason why we were so unsuccessful was that after all, giving a ride to two Indian guys is a lot of "responsibility" for someone to assume.

Hitchhiking is a strange thing to be doing willingly. Aman and I laughed so much during our failed attempts at hitchhiking. We were disheartened but we still did everything else that we wanted to do during my week-long stay in the Netherlands. In mid-April, I was due to return to Europe for a two-week backpacking trip. I wanted to see if I could pull off hitchhiking on my own.

#### The Plan

My plan was to fly from Edinburgh to Szczecin (Poland), stay there for a day and then fly to Warsaw. Then, **I planned to hitch to Paris, stopping in Berlin and Mannheim for a few days each.** The last leg was to travel to Eindhoven (hitch or public transportation depending on my mood) to reunite with Aman.

### Warsaw üáµüá± to Berlin üá©üá™

In Warsaw, I was staying with a person who had over 20,000 km of hitchhiking under his belt. To put into perspective, that's half a trip around the Earth. He suggested that I hitch from a ramp merging onto the highway to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, the closest city on my way to Berlin. Even though I had a plan on how to hitch out of Warsaw, I accepted his advice and went to the suggested spot. It was like the Netherlands all over again, except now I had nobody around to share my misery with. I flew my cardboard sign for an hour and tried many spots along the road but to no avail.

I was losing hope by the second and I questioned why I took my host's advice, knowing full well that I hadn't had any luck hitching from the side of the road. My original plan was to hitch from a gas station outside of Warsaw. It would allow me to talk to the drivers and win them over with my charisma. So I pulled myself together and boarded a bus toward the gas station.

The gas station was 3.5 km away from the last bus stop. Those were the hardest three kms I had ever walked. **I was feeling the heat, both figuratively and literally, so I took my sweater off and tied it to the side of the road.** To be honest, I was waiting for the perfect moment to retire that sweater. Anyhow, I eventually reached the gas station, and boy, was it huge? It was already past noon, so I had to move quick. I put on the most innocuous face possible and began asking strangers for a ride - everyone from a truck driver to people coming out of McDonald's. It was stressful; I got a few scornful looks from the truck drivers and Google Translate didn't prove to be too useful either. After 30 minutes of rejections though, a Polish guy finally offered me an hour-long ride. Of course my energy level went through the roof.

My goal for the day was to reach Berlin. That's 560 km in a day, meaning at least 6-7 hrs on the road. I had lost a lot of time before my short first ride. To make matters worse, I didn't have a tent or a sleeping bag. **If I were to be stranded somewhere, my last option was to hitch to the nearest town and look for a hotel/hostel.** Nonetheless, I wanted to stay positive and as soon as I was dropped off at a rest stop outside ≈Å√≥d≈∫, I started looking again. Surprisingly, the second ride came by relatively quickly. It was a Polish man in his late 40s. He offered to take me to Pozna≈Ñ, which was almost halfway to Berlin.

> <div style="font-style: initial;">Before entering the car, I sneakily memorized the number plate and texted it to some of my friends.</div>

All my doubts were put to rest when he told me that he had hitchhiked in his early days and that he could relate to my struggle. Like most people who picked me up, he asked me about my experience hitching as a brown guy in a region known for its unfriendliness toward foreigners. We talked about my studies and his kids who had recently moved to the US. He even tried to help me hitch a ride before he had to leave. My next two rides were a woman in mid-20s returning from work as well as a businessman who drove me to outside of Berlin. The latter had sailed across the Atlantic (!) when he was younger, so we mostly discussed that as we drove across the Poland-German border. I could sense the cars racing on the autobahn. It was thrilling and I was feeling "successful".

### Berlin üá©üá™ to Mannheim üá©üá™

My CouchSurfing host Paul was hosting another traveler by the name of Nathan. We three didn't get to talk a lot during my two nights there, but we bonded for a bit on hitchhiking. Nathan had also train-hopped in the US, which I didn't have the guts to do, even on a sunny, adventurous afternoon. He had planned to hitch to Innsbruck, Austria (750 km) on the same day I was going to Mannheim (650 km).

The funny thing about hitchhiking out of Berlin is that there's a well-known, hitchhiker-friendly spot on the outskirts of the city. Nathan had left for the spot an hour before me, so when I reached the place, he wasn't there but I saw at least 5 other hitchhikers. It was a sunny morning and I was feeling energetic. To minimize the number of highway changes, I decided to hitch southward, through Leipzig and Nuremberg, instead of westward, through Hanover. It took me a shade under an hour of waiting and asking every single person about to drive off before I could get a yes.

An American couple road-tripping around Europe offered me a ride to Leipzig. The only thing I recall about the ride is the kind of music they had on. They were playing a folk playlist, perhaps some Mumford and Sons and the Lumineers? My next ride turned out to be even more musical. This time, it was a German couple driving to Nuremberg. The women knew Indian belly dancing (!), so I thought she'd enjoy one of my favorite Bollywood songs, [Senorita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a12hdJ9HfSw). And she did! After we shared some more music, I caught up on my sleep for 15 minutes; I thought I could chance it without being disrespectful (or getting kidnapped).

The couple dropped me off at the last gas station before Nuremberg. I then bought some snacks to recharge myself. As I was leaving the store, I saw a car pull over. Nathan was sitting inside it. I couldn't believe it. **To leave "the Berlin spot" at different times and then bump into each other in the middle of nowhere - what were the odds?** His ride (to Munich) was stopping to refuel, so he left soon after we shared a biscuit of two.

My last ride came in at just the right time. A middle-aged woman agreed to drive me to <i>somewhere</i> near Stuttgart. During my two-hour ride, I learned that she had recently turned vegan and that she lived alone. She talked about veganism and her new book on discipline. Her persona reminded me of the movies in which the protagonists live in a lakeside cottage and all they do is read, write and drink whiskey. She dropped me off at a gas station in √ñhringen, a town almost 100 km from Mannheim. Although the gas station was close to the highway, all of its traffic came from within the town. I had grossly misjudged my drop-off. With no luck asking people at the tiny gas station, I stuck out my thumb on the side of the highway ramp. I was tired and all I could notice was some posh cars and people's judgemental looks.

At that point, I was quite hungry, so I grabbed a filling meal at a diner across the ramp. I even tried asking a few cars in the drive-thru. **My philosophy during this trip was to swallow my ego and resist feeling judged.** It was late evening and I had already started brainstorming alternatives. I wanted to avoid staying there overnight and the possibility of finding a reliable, "last-minute CouchSurfing host" was slim. So I began heading toward the bus station which was a 25-minute walk. Five minutes in, I saw another gas station. I don't explain why but I wanted to try my luck there. The first person I asked happened to be going on the highway, though only 20 km further. I asked if she knew how I could reach Mannheim or Heidelberg and she offered to drop me at the Weinsberg train station. It was an amazing feeling. Two out of two days, I was able to hitch over 550 km. Just then, Nathan texted me, "I made it all the way to Innsbruck!"

> <div style="font-style: initial;">Wherever you go, you'll find people who want to help you. Hitchhiking in Germany was a pleasant experience. Unlike the truckers in Warsaw, Germans didn't turn their faces to ignore you. What I realized throughout this trip was that people want to help you. No matter where you go, you'll find more good people than bad even though you might have the misfortune of meeting more bad people than good. Does that make any sense? Germans were incredibly respectful and always said no, instead of rejecting by turning their faces as if I was some serial killer - this is what happened at the giant gas station in Warsaw; dude just say no. I am not biting you, I know what I got myself into and I can handle a no. But it's good to hear a no instead of a disgusted, scornful turn of the head. I am incredibly thankful that I met all these people because I would always have thought, oh there's no you're getting a ride in that area as a brown male.</div>

### Mannheim üá©üá™ to Paris üá´üá∑

After spending an afternoon in the wonderland that is Heidelberg, I said goodbyes to my friend Lukas. He dropped me off at a gas station right on the side of the ramp merging onto the highway. It was early in the morning and I had planned to do 600 kms to Paris. I thought it'd be easy because on hitchwiki.org, people were generally positive about it. I think there I spent the longest in my entire journey waiting for a ride. I asked people inside the store, across the road in the mechanic shop, but to no avail. My final option was to fly my sign. Out of all four times I had tried flying signs, thrice with Aman and once in Stuttgart, I had never been successful. I was honestly not expecting anything. But miraculously, after only fifteen minutes, a car stopped. There were two brown guys, perhaps from Syria (I don't remember entirely). It was a humbling experience  overall. They handed me a 20 euro bill even though I insisted that I didn't need their money. I don't think I looked terribly bad; after all it was the start of the day, kind of. I think it was just their sheer kindness that they wanted to help a "young boy". I didn't have any words to say. I just tried to thank them profusely.

Mannheim to Paris was interesting. I had an overall positive experience asking for rides in Germany. But I knew that the French did not like to speak in English even if they knew it. So I may not have a lot of luck as I got closer to France. Unfortunately, my first ride of the day was really short, still far from Paris. I just knew that I couldn't hitch a ride directly from Saarbruken to Paris, it's too long and asking for such a long ride means instant rejection. I started asking for rides to Metz, a city midway through in hopes that someone could at least take me across the border. It was starting to get late, I tried so much. I think I skipped lunch that day and just ate the peanuts and other snacks I had. I knew that if I wasted anymore time, there was no way I was making it to Paris before dark. And dark is what I did not want to experience. I did not have a tent or a sleeping bag, so to exaggerate and tell you how ballsy I way, my life hinged on those rides. This person was just getting into his car and I approached him asking if he was going in the direction of Metz. He said he wasn't. This usually means no, but I asked him where he was heading and he said he won't stop until the south of Paris. My eyes lit up but I wanted to keep calm. In the politest ways, I asked him if I could join him and that I had been looking for a ride for 2-3 hrs without luck. He agreed and oh my god did I feel on top of the world! I had made it. It was an amazing feeling. This person turned out to be a PhD in some niche science, running his own company, really focused. We talked about random stuff that I don't remember now. He dropped me off at the station [] and gave me his card in case I needed him during my stay in Paris.

I stayed in Paris with my friend Mattis and met Chau and Rafael. My last leg of this trip was Paris to Eindhoven to rejoin my friend Aman. I was a bit exhausted after three full days of hitching, with so much fun filled in between. I also knew that it's a nightmare to hitch out of Paris. I just went easy and took a FlixBus to Antwerpem and then to Eindhoven. Aman and I biked home, with every signal turning green, almost suggesting that I had done it!
