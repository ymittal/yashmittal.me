I was studying in Edinburgh. I don't remember exactly how I got into hitchhiking. Sometime in early March, my friend Reigh and I were sharing our experience of studying abroad. She told me that she had recently hitched from coast to coast in Ireland along with a female friend of hers. Incidentally, I had spent the night prior to our conversation watching random videos related to hitchhiking. To say the least, I was amazed by her story and she encouraged me to give hitchhiking a try.

This is my story of solo hitchhiking over a thousand miles in Europe as a brown male. It is an attempt to document an experience I truly cherish. I have used [Google Maps Timeline](https://www.google.com/maps/timeline) extensively to try to recall the foggy memories.

### The Fails: The Netherlands 🇳🇱

Once I got my Schengen visa, I was all set to visit my friend Aman in Eindhoven. I was pumped and asked him if he wanted to try hitching in the Netherlands. He agreed, no questions asked. We began scouring loads of pages on [hitchwiki.org](http://hitchwiki.org), an encyclopedia for hitchhikers. We both had our doubts and I would be lying if I tell you that I wasn't nervous. The good thing was that Aman was familiar with public transportation there, so we knew we had a fallback option if we were to get no rides whatsoever.

Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened. We tried thrice in three different locations, waiting for around two hours each, but didn't manage to get a single ride. Funnily enough, the only car that stopped for us was police asking us to move to a different, safer place. Although we were standing in a legal spot, we didn't want to take a chance so we moved to another spot.

The next day, we stuck our thumbs out in front of a traffic signal. It was uncomfortable whenever we'd make eye contact with any passengers. We still followed all the basics: shave before going out, smile generously, look them in the eyes, and show both hands. Some of them did smile back but none of the cars stopped. I think the reason why we were so unsuccessful was that after all, giving a ride to two Indian guys is a lot of "responsibility" for someone to assume.

Hitchhiking is a strange thing to be doing willingly. Aman and I laughed so much during our failed attempts at hitchhiking. We were disheartened but we still did everything else that we wanted to do during my week-long stay in the Netherlands. In mid-April, I was due to return to Europe for a two-week backpacking trip. I wanted to see if I could pull off hitchhiking on my own.

#### The Plan

My plan was to fly from Edinburgh to Szczecin (Poland), stay there for a day and then fly to Warsaw. Then, **I planned to hitch to Paris, stopping in Berlin and Mannheim for a few days each.** The last leg was to travel to Eindhoven (hitch or public transportation depending on my mood) to reunite with Aman.

### Warsaw 🇵🇱 to Berlin 🇩🇪

In Warsaw, I was staying with a person who had over 20,000 km of hitchhiking under his belt. To put into perspective, that's half a trip around the Earth. He suggested that I hitch from a ramp merging onto the highway to Łódź, the closest city on my way to Berlin. Even though I had a plan on how to hitch out of Warsaw, I accepted his advice and went to the suggested spot. It was like the Netherlands all over again, except now I had nobody around to share my misery with. I flew my cardboard sign for an hour and tried many spots along the road but to no avail.

I was losing hope by the second and I questioned why I took my host's advice, knowing full well that I hadn't had any luck hitching from the side of a road. My original plan was to hitch from a gas station outside of Warsaw. It would allow me to talk to the drivers and win them over with my charisma. So I pulled myself together and boarded a bus toward the gas station.

The gas station was 3.5 km away from the last bus stop. Those were the hardest three kms I had ever walked. I was feeling the heat, both figuratively and literally, so I took my sweater off and tied it to the side of the road. To be honest, I was waiting for the perfect moment to retire that sweater. Anyhow, I eventually reached the gas station, and boy, was it huge? It was already after noon, so I had to move quick. I put on the most innocuous face possible and began asking strangers for a ride - everyone from a truck driver to people coming out of McDonald's. It was stressful; I got a few scornful looks from the truck drivers and Google Translate didn't prove to be too useful either. After 30 minutes of rejections though, a Polish guy finally offered me an hour-long ride. Of course my energy level went through the roof.

My goal for the day was to reach Berlin. That's 560 km in a day, meaning at least 6-7 hrs on the road. I had lost a lot of time before my short first ride. To make matters worse, I didn't have a tent or a sleeping bag. **If I were to be stranded somewhere, my last option was to hitch to the nearest town and look for a hotel/hostel.** Nonetheless, I wanted to stay positive and as soon as I was dropped off at a rest stop outside Łódź, I started looking again. The second ride came by relatively quickly. It was a Polish man in his late 40s. He offered to take me to Poznań, which was almost halfway to Berlin.

> <div style="font-style: initial;">Before entering his car, I sneakily memorized the number plate and texted it to some of my friends.</div>

All my doubts were put to rest when he told me that he had hitchhiked in his early days and that he could relate to my struggle. Like most people who picked me up, he asked me about my experience hitching as a brown person in a region of the world not known for welcoming foreigners.


I chose the hardest possible starting location. 


It was an interesting time because throughout that journey I constantly checked the GPS to make sure that we were on the right path and that I am safe. He mentioned that because I was brown, people wouldn't give me a ride and that many Polish are racist. The second ride came by relatively easily. I had just spent fifteen odd minutes looking for a ride and a car pulled over to grab food. I asked the person if he was heading in the direction of Poznan and he was! I was kinda taken aback so I sneakily memorized the number plate and sent it to my friend, who by the way I was in touch with for when I would be stranded in the middle of nowhere.

I had an amazing conversation with him. He was my father's age; he talked about his kids and how they are settled and what's good about the US. He seemed genuined interested in helping me because he had hitchhiked in his earlier years. I may be forgetting a ride in the middle but my last ride was the longest. I kinda felt bad because I think my driver initially didn't seem interested; he kinda knew that I was looking for a ride even before I approached him. Anyway he was heading straight to outside of Berlin and he kinded took me in. We crossed the Poland-Germany border and I could see the cars racing on the autobahns. It was thrilling and I was feeling relieved and successful that I had made it that day.

### Berlin 🇩🇪 to Mannheim 🇩🇪

I was CouchSurfing in Berlin and my host had another peson [Nathan?] over. We didn't get a chance to talk a whole in the two nights that I spent on his couch. But all of us bonded for a bit on hitchhiking; Nathan had train-hopped in the US before and I thought that was incredible. I didn't know you could even do that; I don't have the balls to do it - even if I am feeling adventurous. He was going to hitchhike to Insbruck and I was to Mannheim on the same day. He left an hour earlier because he had to cover almost 700 km in day.

The interesting thing is that there's actually a hitchhiker friendly spot in Berlin where when I went there I saw a lot of people trying to hitch rides. It was fascinating but also saddening to see people "stealing" your rides. Anyway the day was young and I was feeling energetic, especially after my first success. It took me more than an hour of waiting and asking almost every single person who drove their car off if they were willing to give me a ride. Incidentally, I managed to bag to rides within a span a minute. I chose the American couple in a sedan over a European couple in a hot back with motor running. The man was interesting in that he served in the armed forces (not sure) and would move around a lot. The girl played exactly the type of music I like to listen to: folk and indie. I can't recall the exact names but definitely Mumford and Sons and the Lumineers. My next ride was someone from [] who liked Indian belly dancing, what! As far as I can recall, she understood a bit of Spanish and I was in a jolly mood, so I played one of my favorite Bollywood songs Senorita, she loved it! I caught up on some sleep; I felt quite comfortable because there was another person whom the couple did not know. I thought I could chance it and sleep without getting kidnapped.

What I realized throughout this trip was that people want to help you. No matter where you go, you'll find more good people than bad even though you might have the misfortune of meeting more bad people than good. Does that make any sense? Germans were incredibly respectful and always said no, instead of rejecting by turning their faces as if I was some serial killer - this is what happened at the giant gas station in Warsaw; dude just say no. I am not biting you, I know what I got myself into and I can handle a no. But it's good to hear a no instead of a disgusted, scornful turn of the head. I am incredibly thankful that I met all these people because I would always have thought, oh there's no you're getting a ride in that area as a brown male.

The craziest thing happened here. I met Nathan. I was super pumped. What are the odds? The same petrol pump, same time, we even left at different times. His ride was stopping to recharge, so he left soon afterwards.

My last ride came in at just about the right time. This time, it was someone who had just turned vegan. She talked about discipline and how she was in the process of writing a book on veganism. She lived alone, most of the time she spent writing books. She reminded me of those movies in which people have their houses near the lake and all they do is read, write and occasionally drink wine and whiskey or both. I was dropped off a bit outside of Stuttgart, a bit in the middle of a lot of things. I had grossly misjudged the area; it was not outside the city. There was a food festival happening nearby. I was feeling super hungry so I thought I would check it out. After some time, I resumed my search for a ride. I had almost made it, but not quite. I was still 100 km away from Mannheim. When I had no luck asking people on the tiny gas station, most of the cars were inside of the city, I thought I'd finally fly the sign. I stood on the side of a ramp which was going to merge into the highway I wanted to go on. I felt uncomfortable, all I could feel was that every single pair of eyes that looked at me was judging me. It looked like a posch district with lots of fancy motor cycles and cars; a few people laughed off my face too which I did mind at that time but oh well.

I was feeling a bit hungry. I crossed the road and ate my filling dinner at a McDonald's. Once done, I asked cars in line for take out. My philosophy during this entire trip was, oh I'm not going to see these people again, so I can try to curb my feeling about how these people are going to look at me. They can simply turn me down afterall and if they choose to be disrespectul, I'll take it. There was no luck. At this point, I had already started brainstorming alternatives. It was a small town, so I did not want to spend the night there and the chances of finding a "last-minute CouchSurfing host" were bleak. I started walking to the bus station which was a 20 minute walk. Five minutes in, I saw this gas station, again in the middle of the city but I don't know why, I wanted to ask if anyone was going my way. I just asked one person and she happened to going that way, albeit only 10-15 kms further. I asked if she knew how I could reach Mannheim/Heidelberg and she said she could drop me at [] where I could catch a train. It was an amazing feeling. Even though I paid a bit for the train(s) I got on to reach Mannheim Central, it was worth the experience. Two out of two days, I had managed to hitch over 500 kms. I messaged Nathan and he said, "yes, easy!"

### Mannheim 🇩🇪 to Paris 🇫🇷

After spending an afternoon in the wonderland that is Heidelberg, I said goodbyes to my friend Lukas. He dropped me off at a gas station right on the side of the ramp merging onto the highway. It was early in the morning and I had planned to do 600 kms to Paris. I thought it'd be easy because on hitchwiki.org, people were generally positive about it. I think there I spent the longest in my entire journey waiting for a ride. I asked people inside the store, across the road in the mechanic shop, but to no avail. My final option was to fly my sign. Out of all four times I had tried flying signs, thrice with Aman and once in Stuttgart, I had never been successful. I was honestly not expecting anything. But miraculously, after only fifteen minutes, a car stopped. There were two brown guys, perhaps from Syria (I don't remember entirely). It was a humbling experience  overall. They handed me a 20 euro bill even though I insisted that I didn't need their money. I don't think I looked terribly bad; after all it was the start of the day, kind of. I think it was just their sheer kindness that they wanted to help a "young boy". I didn't have any words to say. I just tried to thank them profusely.

Mannheim to Paris was interesting. I had an overall positive experience asking for rides in Germany. But I knew that the French did not like to speak in English even if they knew it. So I may not have a lot of luck as I got closer to France. Unfortunately, my first ride of the day was really short, still far from Paris. I just knew that I couldn't hitch a ride directly from Saarbruken to Paris, it's too long and asking for such a long ride means instant rejection. I started asking for rides to Metz, a city midway through in hopes that someone could at least take me across the border. It was starting to get late, I tried so much. I think I skipped lunch that day and just ate the peanuts and other snacks I had. I knew that if I wasted anymore time, there was no way I was making it to Paris before dark. And dark is what I did not want to experience. I did not have a tent or a sleeping bag, so to exaggerate and tell you how ballsy I way, my life hinged on those rides. This person was just getting into his car and I approached him asking if he was going in the direction of Metz. He said he wasn't. This usually means no, but I asked him where he was heading and he said he won't stop until the south of Paris. My eyes lit up but I wanted to keep calm. In the politest ways, I asked him if I could join him and that I had been looking for a ride for 2-3 hrs without luck. He agreed and oh my god did I feel on top of the world! I had made it. It was an amazing feeling. This person turned out to be a PhD in some niche science, running his own company, really focused. We talked about random stuff that I don't remember now. He dropped me off at the station [] and gave me his card in case I needed him during my stay in Paris.

I stayed in Paris with my friend Mattis and met Chau and Rafael. My last leg of this trip was Paris to Eindhoven to rejoin my friend Aman. I was a bit exhausted after three full days of hitching, with so much fun filled in between. I also knew that it's a nightmare to hitch out of Paris. I just went easy and took a FlixBus to Antwerpem and then to Eindhoven. Aman and I biked home, with every signal turning green, almost suggesting that I had done it!
