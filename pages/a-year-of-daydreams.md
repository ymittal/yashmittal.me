how do i salvage what remains  
of your memory, now blurry and dim?  
my voice crackles as i try to recollect  
threads of joy, so fleeting and unbelievably thin.

yes, i do hold tight, maybe too much -  
feelings felt only after you were gone.  
silence now lingers where once my doorbell rang,  
i stay stuck, unwilling to let go or move on.

it troubles me not that we fell through  
for, as they say, perhaps “not meant to be”.  
what weighs on me is the time i didn’t give,  
the chance to talk and uncover what we could be.

i wish i could turn back the clock,  
thank you for your countless rides to and fro.  
it stands to be my biggest regret,  
that I wasn’t vulnerable enough to let my emotions flow.

there’s tasks i can no longer begin,  
races through my mind a thought of you.  
making chai is such a chore nowadays,  
forgotten how to wear that soapy perfume i once knew.

of all the things i miss,  
the hugs at bathurst & king take the cake.  
your broken attempts at _gulabi aankhen_ a close second,  
and perhaps the Turkish cafes for the evening break.

what drew me in were your humble beginnings,  
a sense of aura, oh so fearless and bold.  
from those downhill bike rides as a kid,  
to stand-up now, the timeless stories fail to grow old.

there’s no one else i’d rather hitch rides with,  
but alas, it was a bunch of talk.  
the ‘water under the bridge’ feels colder tonight,  
my actions a bit uncommitted to walk the walk.

too optimistic for my own good,  
i still believe, almost delusional to quit.  
a year of daydreams later, wishing you’d find me,  
i pray i don’t lose this hope, lest there's a fit.
